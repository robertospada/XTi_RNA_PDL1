Imaging Mass Cytometry\u2122 (IMC\u2122), now powered by the Hyperion XTi Imaging System, is a proven tool for the study of complex cellular interactions in the TME. It utilizes CyTOF\u00aetechnology for simultaneous assessment of 40-plus protein markers at subcellular resolution without spectral overlap or background autofluorescence, thus providing unprecedented insight into the organization and complexity of the tissue microenvironment.\n\nDespite this, some protein targets are challenging to include in IMC as they have very few or no commercial antibodies available. Moreover, although cellular identity can easily be deciphered through detection of protein targets, knowledge of the cell\u2019s transcriptome improves understanding of cellular function and activation state. Here, we present a robust and reliable workflow that combines the highly sensitive and specific RNAscope\u2122 technology for RNA detection with the multiplexing capability of IMC to visualize key RNA and protein markers in the same tumor samples, and how the Hyperion XTi imaging system is capable of detecting even very poorly expressed markers like PD-L1. \n", "Rotation": 0, "Layout": {"Grid": [["i0"]]}, "Stories": [{"Name": "", "Description": "", "Waypoints": [{"Name": "RNA and protein co-detection", "Description": "RNAscopeHiPlexv2 assay was combined with protein detection using IMC to evaluate expression of both RNA and protein targets in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue microarray (TMA).
